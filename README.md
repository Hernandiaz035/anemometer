# Anemometer Based on Ultrasonic Signals Timing

Plannig to 

Common anemometers has several problems:
* Needing of special calibration in a wind tunnel.
* Dependency of specific random constants, provided by the shape and the atack angle of the cups, quantity of cups.
* Very limited range of wind speed.
* Use of mechanical parts that could suffer wear under hostile weather, like bearings getting rust.
* Needs some optical or magnetic encoder, in case this are homemade, they would have a poor resolution.
* For wind direction meassure is necesary a "wind vane", in case this is homemade preserve a absolute refference with an encoder is a complex task.
